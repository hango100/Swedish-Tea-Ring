Recipe for Swedish Tea Ring

Ingredients:

For the Enriched Dough:

1 package active dry yeast
¼ cup lukewarm water (for yeast)
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons sugar (for dough)
2 teaspoons salt
2 tablespoons shortening
¾ cup lukewarm water (additional, for dough)
1 egg, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons melted butter (for dough)
Approximately 6 cups flour (adjust as needed)
For Tea Ring Filling:

Melted butter (for brushing the dough)
Brown sugar (to taste)
Cinnamon (to taste)
Raisins (to taste)
For Decoration:

½ cup confectioners' sugar (for frosting)
1 to 1½ tablespoons light cream (for frosting)
Chopped nuts (optional)
Candied fruit (optional)


Instructions:

Prepare Yeast Mixture:

In a small bowl, dissolve 1 package of active dry yeast in ¼ cup of lukewarm water. Set aside until it becomes foamy, about 5-10 minutes.
Mix Wet Ingredients:

In a saucepan, scald 1 cup of milk. Pour into the mixer bowl.
Add 2 tablespoons sugar, 2 teaspoons salt, 2 tablespoons shortening, and ¾ cup lukewarm water to the hot milk. Stir until the shortening is melted. Allow the mixture to cool to lukewarm.
Combine with Flour and Other Ingredients:

Attach the dough hook to your mixer.
With the mixer on a low setting, add about 3 cups of flour, 1 beaten egg, 2 tablespoons melted butter, and ¼ cup sugar to the milk mixture. Mix until smooth.
Add the softened yeast and mix.
Gradually add more flour (up to 3 additional cups) until the dough starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl but is still slightly sticky to the touch.
Knead the Dough:

Knead with the mixer on a medium-low setting for about 5-7 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic.
First Rise:

Transfer the dough to a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top.
Cover with a clean towel and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1-2 hours.
Shape Tea Ring:

Punch down the dough and divide it into 2 equal parts. Let them rest for 10 minutes.
Roll out one portion into a ½-inch thick rectangle.
Brush with melted butter and sprinkle with brown sugar, cinnamon, and raisins.
Roll up tightly, seal the edge, and form into a ring.
Make cuts 2/3 through at 1-inch intervals and turn slices slightly.
Place on a baking sheet, cover, and let rise for about 45 minutes.
Bake:

Preheat your oven to 350° F.
Bake the tea ring for about 30 minutes or until golden brown.
Decorate:

Mix ½ cup confectioners' sugar with 1-1½ tablespoons light cream to make a glaze.
Drizzle over the warm tea ring and sprinkle with chopped nuts and candied fruit if desired.
